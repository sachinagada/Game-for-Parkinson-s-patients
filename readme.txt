Description of project:
My project is targeted towards Parkinson's patients by making a series of mini games that forces them to work out with the help of Kinect. The three mini games are fruit ninja, boxing, and soccer. Fruit ninja is adapted from the phone app but the player must move his/her arms in order to cut the fruit. Random fruit will be tossed up the bottom of the screen and the fruit will start to move downwards. The player must cut the fruit before the fruit reaches the bottom. If there are 5 misses, the player will be forced to stretch their arms to improve flexibility and the program will detect whether the player is actually stretching. If the player cuts 25 fruits before missing, the program moves on to the next game: boxing. In boxing, boxing gloves will appear on the screen and move around and the player has to move around and duck to avoid getting punched. If the player is hit 5 times or successfully avoids 20 gloves, the program moves on to the next game: soccer. For soccer, the player must kick the ball and score a goal. Points are awarded when the player cuts the fruit, avoids getting punched, and makes a goal in the three games. The game ends when the player makes 10 goals. 

How to run the project:
Connect the Kinect to your computer and place the kinect on a level surface. Open and run the file PythonApplication3.py. Make sure the image files attached in the "Project Source and Support Files" folder are in the same level directory as the PythonApplcation3.py file. This file can only be run window8+ computers!

Third party modules:
Pygame and pykinect2 

How to install them:
-Install pygame from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame and install pygame-1.9.2a0-cpXX-none-win32.whl where XX represents your python version. Run pygame.exe from the top level directory
-Install pykinect2 from  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 and follow the on screen directions from the microsoft website.
